Develop a multiplayer game simulation that encompasses all the programming concepts covered in "Java Programming 2" course. The functionality that is implemented includes:

Implementing the game engine that includes the basic business logic of the game and the data structure through the hierarchy of data classes.
Creating a JavaFX graphical user interface that allows users to use the application.
Designing the graphical user interface using best practices and based on advanced programming solutions and using the MVC design pattern.
Using advanced and automated notification mechanisms for changes between the graphical user interface and the business logic of the application.
Upgrading the application's graphical user interface to be responsive using multithreading, thread implementation, and synchronization through advanced higher-level abstraction libraries.
Retrieving and processing application data and resources asynchronously.
Implementing the ability to permanently store the game's state on the disk using serialization. Enabling the game to restart from a previous state by deserialization.
Determining the need for documentation of the specific business logic of the game and generating program code documentation using the "Reflection API".
Implementing network communication that allows playing the game in a networked environment. Sending player move data using TCP or UDP protocols, and implementing "socket" communication using threads.
Implementing the selection of opponents in games and communication ("chat") during game play using JNDI and RMI technologies.
Using SAX/DOM libraries to enable saving game configuration in XML format and implementing dynamic reading and writing of data to XML files.
